Ideas and TODOs:

Compile CoffeeScript for modules with --bare (no top-level function wrapper), as module is always just
define([..], function() { ... });

Replace default.css with Twitter Bootstrap + Tapestry extensions.

Include a new Java module that supports writing an exception log file on error.

Merge PageCatalog and ServiceStatus into a Dashboard page
- make it extensible

Add way to have services self describe (for dashboard and/or exception report).

Add way for services to expose simple actions to the Dashboard (i.e., tie a UI button to a callback).

JavaScriptWrapper (.jsw) may not be needed after all, due to ShimModule.

Ideas and TODOs:

Include a new Java module that supports writing an exception log file on error.

New module to replace tapestry-yuicompressor that is based on WRO4J.

Start collecting various stats, store in RRD (round robin database), expose on Dashboard

Add way to have services self describe (for dashboard and/or exception report).

Add way for services to expose simple actions to the Dashboard (i.e., tie a UI button to a callback).

Higher level way to assemble JavaScript inside ModuleManagerImpl and ability to feed it though minimizer? Probably not worth effort,
as minimizer may only shrink a few spaces.

Require that all assets be stored under MODULE-INF/assets/. Make @Inject @Path & related
code smart to check in both places (in 5.4) or just MODULE-INF/ in 5.5.

Make sure that all new dependencies have their LICENCE-foo.txt file included.

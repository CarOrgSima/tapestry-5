Scratch pad for changes destined for the 5.4 release notes page.

Breaking Features:

The definition of the symbol 'tapestry.asset-path-prefix' has changed; it no longer includes the leading and
trailing slashes. The default in 5.3 was "/assets/", in 5.4 it is simply "assets".

Bugs fixed (in 5.4-js-rewrite branch):

TAP5-1965: Replace use of Request.getContextPath() with a symbol define at application startup

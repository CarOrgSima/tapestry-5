Scratch pad for changes destined for the 5.4 release notes page.

Breaking Features:

The definition of the symbol 'tapestry.asset-path-prefix' has changed; it no longer includes the leading and
trailing slashes. The default in 5.3 was "/assets/", in 5.4 it is simply "assets".

JavaScript Libraries (including stacks) are being replaced with modules. Note that libraries are now loaded
with RequireJS, which may mean that global values exported by the libraries are not visible; you should explicitly
attach properties to the global JavaScript window object, rather than assume that the context (this) is the window.

The interface org.apache.tapestry5.services.assets.ResourceTransformer has had a new method added:
getTransformedContentType().

Minor changes to Tapestry.ElementEffects.

Tapestry code no longer makes use of Scriptaculous. Instead, Tapestry will fire events on elements, and user code
may decide to animate them using whatever library is desired.
